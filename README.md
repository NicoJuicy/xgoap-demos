# XGOAP Demos

Demos for [Beyond GOAP](https://github.com/active-logic/xgoap), a goal oriented action planner for Unity3D and .NET core.

Demos run in Unity 2019 (maybe 2018).

## Baker demo

Simple non visual integration showing the use of `GameAI` for planning and driving plan execution.
Since this is also used in functional testing, sources are in the main XGOAP repo:

- Behavior (added to scene) : [BakerAI.cs](https://github.com/active-logic/xgoap/blob/master/Runtime/Demos/BakerAI.cs)
- Planning model: [Baker.cs](https://github.com/active-logic/xgoap/blob/master/Runtime/Demos/Baker.cs)

## Sentinel demo (WIP)

Pathfinding, shooting and solving spatial puzzles such as opening a path by moving blocks.

See [tutorial/info](Assets/Sentinel/README.md)
