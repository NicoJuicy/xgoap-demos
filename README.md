# XGOAP Demos

Currently this repository only contains a trivial application demonstrating that a `GameAI` subclass can be added to a Unity object, and will perform planning and execution as intended.

Since demo files are also used in functional testing, sources are in the main XGOAP repo:

- Behavior (added to scene) : [BakerAI.cs](https://github.com/active-logic/xgoap/blob/master/Runtime/Demos/BakerAI.cs)
- Planning model: [Baker.cs](https://github.com/active-logic/xgoap/blob/master/Runtime/Demos/Baker.cs)

## Requests open

I am currently picking a topic for a more visual XGOAP demonstration. Open to suggestions.
