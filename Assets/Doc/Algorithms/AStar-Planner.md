# A* Planner

The A* planner implements a variant of best-first search guided by a *g(n) + h(n)* estimate, where:
g(n) is the cost to reach n from the starting point.
h(n) is an estimated cost to reach the goal from n.

[Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) via Wikipedia

## Compatibility with BeFS and BrFS

The planner can 'downgrade' to either simple cost minimization, or breadth first search.
